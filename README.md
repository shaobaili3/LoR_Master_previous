## Development & Contribution

LoR Master Tracker is written by pure [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for cross-platform and local port retrieval. So it can be easily migrated to any different platforms. The Interface is built by [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)(No interface builder). I am planning to use Firebase as database and Vue/React as Front-end, besides Electron and Django/Flask frameworks are used to generate both desktop application and web application. This project will be open source before the first stable release(v1.0.0) in the [new repo](https://github.com/shaobaili3/LoR-Master-Tracker). If you want to contribute the project early, please feel free to contact me to add you to my private repo.
