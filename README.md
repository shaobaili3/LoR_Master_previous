    > ### ⚠️ Disclaimer:
    > Opponent decks are pulled from recent 10 matches by Riot API. Even if there is no third-parties data requests, this function may still create an unfair advantage for players, which may violate [POLICIES](https://developer.riotgames.com/policies/general). We are still working on the adjustment for this function. We may remove it in the next version. We are looking forward to getting feedback from the community and Riot and actively upgrade LMT.
